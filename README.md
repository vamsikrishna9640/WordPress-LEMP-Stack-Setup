# rtCamp-Assignment
The Task is to create a command-line script to set up a WordPress site using a LEMP stack in Docker containers. The script should check for and install Docker and Docker Compose if necessary, create a site with a user-provided name, and add an /etc/hosts entry for the site. It should also have subcommands to enable/disable and delete the site.
